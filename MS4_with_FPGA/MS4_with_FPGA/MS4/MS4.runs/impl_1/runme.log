WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net nolabel_line10/IN5/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin nolabel_line10/IN5/num_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell nolabel_line10/IN5/num_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PLHOLDVIO-2) Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations - A LUT Q_reg_i_1 is driving clock pin of 6 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    IF_ID/genblk1[39].FF/Q_reg {FDRE}
    IF_ID/genblk1[34].FF/Q_reg {FDRE}
    IF_ID/genblk1[35].FF/Q_reg {FDRE}
    IF_ID/genblk1[38].FF/Q_reg {FDRE}
    IF_ID/genblk1[36].FF/Q_reg {FDRE}
