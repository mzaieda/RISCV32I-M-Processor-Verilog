Note that there are two folders concerning MS4, one with the FPGA implementation and the other is with the simulation implementation. Zaeida tried to support the bonus feature of calculating the branch outcome in the decode stage, but we did not fully implement it in the project by really instantiating the module in the top module.
This project supports all 40 instructions of the RISCV32I instruction set. We start some part in supporting integer multiplication and division.
